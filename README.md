TODO:

1. Add fretboard for each scale
2. Add songwriting tips:
* Try dropping the 7th in Secondary Dominants and use as a Major Chord.  Secondary Dominants work for both Major and Minor Chords.
* Try inversions (e.g. swap root bass note in chord with 3rd or 5th) to smooth out the bass line in the progression.
* Try borrowing chords from other tonic scales and modes.
3. Add non-modal scales, like:

C Byzantine Scale	I	II	III	IV	V	VI	VII
Intervals	H	H	H	W	H	H	H
Harmonization	M	M	m	m	M(b5)	aug.	n/a
Scale	C	Db	E	F	G	Ab	B
Harmonized Chords	C	Db	Em	Fm	G(b5)	Ab aug.	n/a
Secondary Dominant							
Major Tonic Chord							
* Basically the Ionian / Major with II and VI reduced by half-step							
* try V as (X7/b5 or X7/b9)							
* try III as M							
* the scale is highly centered around the tonic chord, so you could drone that chord and play the scale as lead on top							
* the seventh can't really be harmonized							
* Goes by many names: Hungarian Folk, Mayamalavagowla, Bhairav Raga, Arabic (Hijaz Kar), and Gypsy major
